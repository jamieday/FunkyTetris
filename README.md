# FunkyTetris
*Functional programming & Tetris*

Ideas:  
  - [ ] UI touch-ups (centering, colors, etc)
  - [x] New favicon
  - [ ] Touch-ups: Rotation tweaks, display in mini boards
  - [x] Lambda Tetromino ;)
  - [ ] Scoring / leveling system
  - [ ] Co-op multiplayer + vs mode (local + websockets?)
